This repository contains resources from various programs to ease homogenization of our work in the
CEHD. It has very simple stuff as frames to include tables and figures in LaTeX with nice options,
a file with the basic packages, functions, and commands in this same program, etc. It has documents
on basic methodologies accompanied with code, plot snippets, and etc.
Please add useful resources, make a pull and let know the users. Try to document/comments your stuff
as all the documents/files here are.
